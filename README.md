# Alex Chi's Lecture Notes

This repo contains my notes for some of the courses.

## Contribution

Feel free to discuss and help improve the notes by submitting an issue. I'll look into it and update my notes. I hope that my notes would contribute to your academic well-being in these courses.

I'm grateful to every one who wants to contribute. However, I decided not to accept pull requests at this time. Just open an issue and I'll fix it.

## Courses

* Computer Organization by Professor H.Z. Zhu
* Computer Architecture by Professor Y.Y. Shen
* Operating System by Professor F. Wu

## Tips

**Commit Policy** I'll only retain the latest commit of this repo. Therefore, you won't be able to browse history. But I'll state what
changes I've made each time in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

**Made with Emacs and org-mode** Most of the notes are written with Spacemacs and org-mode. I just make pdf exports of these notes in public. If you want, you may request a copy of org-mode source code by sending email to me.

**Notes will expire** <del>I'll purge all notes from GitHub after the courses end.</del> I decided to retain these notes on GitHub. All notes are only intended for ONLINE READING.

**Academic Integrity** I may attach some source code to better illustrate the ideas in notes. If you want to use these code snippets in your course work or course projects, you should cite the source clearly.

Also, here's some advice on using my notes.

* My notes serve as an outline for a course. In these notes, I won't
  dive too deep into details. I would recommend
  [H.J. Fang's Lecture Notes](https://github.com/Galaxies99/SJTU-course-notes)
  for his instructive and detailed approach in explaining concepts,
  illustrating key ideas, and presenting examples.
* I prefer plain-text notes. If I have a figure to present, generally I
  would draw it with [ASCII Flow](http://asciiflow.com/), or I just
  refer to a figure in slides.
* Personally, I use these notes as a reminder of structure (or TOC) of a course.
  I would review these notes on a weekly basis.
* I'll also add my own thoughts into the notes. For example, I've given
  many examples on [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) in operating
  system notes.
* I enjoy discussing with my peers. I take record of Q&A in course. The
  answers are summed up from the professor, combining with my own knowledge.
* For final-term revision, I would make mindmaps from textbook and slides.
  This part will be uploaded when it comes to last few weeks of a semester.
